Don’t use Quirks mode! jQuery has never supported Quirks mode and we do not perform any testing in Quirks.
This can affect values like $("window").height(), and the jQuery 1.8 Quirks mode results did change in order to support some modern browser features.
The majority of problem cases we’ve seen are from developers that wanted to be in Standards mode but had an invalid doctype or extraneous markup before their <html> tag.
When in doubt, use the simple and short <!doctype html>.
